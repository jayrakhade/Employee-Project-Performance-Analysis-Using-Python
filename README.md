# Employee-Project-Performance-Analysis-Using-Python
## Project Overview
This project focuses on data cleaning, transformation, and analysis using Python, Pandas, and NumPy. The dataset consists of Employee, Seniority Level, and Project Data, and the project involves handling missing values, merging datasets, and applying business logic to evaluate employee performance based on project success.
## Key Tasks & Analysis
âœ… Data Handling & Storage
Created three DataFrames from raw data and saved them as .csv files.
Loaded and processed .csv files using Pandas.

âœ… Data Cleaning & Transformation
Handled missing values using a running average method with a For loop.
Split a column into two separate columns using str.split().
Merged multiple DataFrames using Pandas merge().
Applied conditional transformations using apply() and lambda.

âœ… Business Logic Implementation
Updated values in columns based on conditions using IF statements.
Performed group-by operations for aggregated calculations.
Used string operations (str.contains()) to filter data.
Implemented loops and indexing for efficient data processing.

âœ… Data Export & Reporting
Created and saved a summary DataFrame with specific calculated metrics.
Removed unnecessary columns and saved the final processed dataset.

## Skills & Tools Used
ðŸ”¹ Python (Pandas, NumPy)
